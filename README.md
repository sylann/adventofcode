# Advent Of Code

This is just a personal repo for puzzles of https://adventofcode.com.

Contains a cool helper script to automatically download, organize and run a
puzzle by simply giving a **year** and a **day** in the CLI.

Initially thought to work with python files but it should work with any immediately
executable script file (as opposed to files that need to be compiled first).

## Get started

- Have python installed (3.10 at least)

- Setup authentication
  (This lets you download your input files from https://adventofcode.com)

  - If not done already, create an account on https://adventofcode.com
  - Authenticate on the website
  - inspect requests
  - retrieve the `Cookie` header
  - paste it in the [.cookie](./.cookie) file

- [aoc.py](./aoc.py) should already be executable.
  (If not, run `chmod u+x aoc.py` on Linux/MacOS)

- Prepare a puzzle, for example the first of 2022: `./aoc.py 2022 1`

  - This also runs the file but if it did not exist, it won't do much at first ðŸ˜…

- Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰

## TODO

Add support for rust files.

## Disclaimer

I'm not trying to make this work on Windows. It might work, but I doubt it.
